## About
This is a virtual library app where users can input the author, title, and number of pages of their favorite books. They can change the status of each book, to whether they've already read it or not. Users can also delete books so they have space for new ones. Everything is stored inside an array and the program will update it based on users' actions.

## What I Did
This project was my first foray into working with Javascript's objects. Before this, I had spent a few weeks going through their theories/concepts. Although I understood them then, it wasn't until I finished this Library app that my brain fully processed the information. I guess there is no better way to learn than to practice.

I also revisited the mobile-first web responsive design for this project. The approach started to grow on me. Really.

Furthermore, I got a chance to practice on my HTML form. I found that it's tricky to style form since you have to rely on pseudo elements most of the time to make it look nice.

## Installation & Set Up
1. You have to fork this repo first. Github has a their own [step-by-step guide with pictures to follow along](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository).
- **Note**: You have the option of changing the name of your forked repo.
2. And to have all the files locally on your computer, open Terminal -> change the current directory to the directory you want to put this forked repo. Then, enter the command line below:
```
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/library.git
```
- **Note**: If you change the name of your forked repo, replace 'library.git' with '[your-forked-repo-name].git'. Github will automatically do this for you when you copy the link.
3. Finally, change to your new forked repo directory.
```
cd library
```
or
```
cd [your-forked-repo-name]
```
